## Image Classification for low resolution clothing images

The following is the code and report for an image classification project as apart of Tufts CS135, Intro to Machine Learning. We were given a labeled data set of low resolution clothing images and our goal was to create a model that would generalize well to new data points. The first component of the assignment was making a MLP with one hidden layer and with minimal data set modifications, and the second component was to make a model of our own choice, allowing for full data modification, including dupicating data points, and transforming images. Our inital approach for part 2 was to use a foundation model designed for image classification, but we ended up settling for a MLP with several hidden layers and some tweaks to our dataset. More details can be found in our writeup, **report.pdf**.
